            Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an increase in mental health and substance use disorders in the United States. Join SAMHSAâ€™s Homeless and Housing Resource Center in exploring equitable and culturally appropriate interventions to engage people experiencing homelessness in treatment and deliver services in non-congregate settings. Participants will hear from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and Central City Concern about the creative methods they have used during the pandemic. Participants will also learn self-care strategies from the National Council for Behavioral Health to avoid burnout during and after the pandemic.
